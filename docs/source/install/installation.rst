--------------------------------------
This is the most important part of a documentation theme. If you like the general look of the theme, please make sure that it is possible to easily navigate through this sample documentation.

Ideally, the pages listed below should also be reachable via links somewhere else on this page (like the sidebar, or a topbar). If they are not, then this theme might need additional configuration to provide the sort of site navigation that’s necessary for “real” documentation.

Some pages like Placeholder Page Three are declared in a “hidden” toctree, and thus would not be visible above. However, they are still a part of the overall site hierarchy and some themes may choose to present them to the user in the site navigation.
